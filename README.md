# libteal

Update 30 June 2022: After having a bit of fun learning Awk, I've decided to go back to Python. The speed
of development is simply faster, even though the code complexity of a single integrated application is
greater. For the time being, I do not anticipate further work on libteal.

Library of useful shell code to facilitate other projects.

As I identify common pieces of code that I want to be able to reuse from project to project, I will be
populating this repository.
