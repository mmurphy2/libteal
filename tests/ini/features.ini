; We can reference environment variables like this:
home = ${[HOME]}

; INI permits a key and a section to have the same name!
conflict = this is the conflicting key

[conflict]
message = this is the conflicting section

[dots]
. = This should be s_dots/k_.
.. = This should be s_dots/k_..
     Oh, and it can be multiline too
     And = it can have embedded equals

; Testing parameterized section names
[part /dev/sda1]
message = hello
